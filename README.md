# PALLM: Evaluating and Enhancing Palliative Care Conversations with Large Language Models

This repository contains supplementary materials and data for the paper "PALLM: Evaluating and Enhancing Palliative Care Conversations with Large Language Models," which was submitted to the ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcareâ€™s Special Issue on Large Language Models, Conversational Systems, and Generative AI in Health.

The repository currently includes benchmark scripts (in `scripts/`) developed and annotated by our clinical team to assess language models' effectiveness in evaluating key clinical communication metrics: understanding, empathy, emotion, presence, and clarity.
